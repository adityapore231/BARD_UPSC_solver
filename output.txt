Q5. Which one of the following is the best
example of repeated falls in sea level,
giving rise to present-day extensive
marshland?
(a) Bhitarkanika Mangroves
(b) Marakkanam Salt Pans
(c) Naupada Swamp
(d) Rann of Kutch

Answer :

The answer is (d), Rann of Kutch.

The Rann of Kutch is a large, flat, saline wetland in the Kutch district of Gujarat, India. It is a remnant of the Arabian Sea, which once covered the area. However, repeated falls in sea level have left the Rann as a vast, desolate salt desert.

The Bhitarkanika Mangroves, Marakkanam Salt Pans, and Naupada Swamp are all examples of marshland that has been formed by other processes, such as river deltas and coastal erosion.

Here are some additional details about the Rann of Kutch:

* It is the largest salt desert in India, covering an area of approximately 26,000 square kilometers.
* It is a seasonal wetland, flooding during the monsoon season and drying out in the winter.
* It is home to a variety of wildlife, including flamingos, pelicans, and crocodiles.
* It is a major salt-producing region, producing approximately 10 million tons of salt per year.

* Sambar Deer are crepuscular animals, meaning they are most active at dawn and dusk.

Therefore, only the Malabar Civet and the Sambar Deer are generally nocturnal or most active after sunset.

Q15. Which of the following organisms·perform
waggle dance for others of their kin
to indicate the direction and the
distance to a source of their food?
(a) Butterflies
(b) Dragonflies
(c) Honeybees
(d) Wasps

Answer :

The answer is (c). Honeybees are the only organisms that perform waggle dances. The waggle dance is a figure-eight dance that honeybees perform to communicate the direction and distance to a food source. The angle of the waggle run indicates the direction of the food source relative to the sun, and the length of the waggle run indicates the distance to the food source.

Butterflies, dragonflies, and wasps do not perform waggle dances. Butterflies and dragonflies use visual cues to find food, and wasps use scent trails.

(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

Answer :

The correct answer is **(b) Only two**.

* Only statement (2) is correct. Some microorganisms, such as psychrophiles, can grow in environments with temperatures below the freezing point of water. For example, psychrophiles can be found in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, where the temperature can be below -40 degrees Celsius.
* Statements (1) and (3) are incorrect. No known microorganisms can grow in environments with temperatures above the boiling point of water (100 degrees Celsius) or with a pH below 0.

Here are some examples of microorganisms that can grow in extreme environments:

* **Psychrophiles:** These microorganisms can grow in environments with temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius. They are found in places like the Arctic and Antarctic, as well as in the coldest parts of the ocean.
* **Thermophiles:** These microorganisms can grow in environments with temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius. They are found in places like hot springs, geysers, and volcanic vents.
* **Alkaliphiles:** These microorganisms can grow in environments with a pH above 9. They are found in places like soda lakes and salt marshes.
* **Acidsophiles:** These microorganisms can grow in environments with a pH below 4. They are found in places like mine drainage and the stomachs of some animals.

Q22. Consider the following statements :
Statement-I :
In the post-pandemic recent past,
many Central Banks worldwide had
carried out interest rate hikes.
Statement-II :
Central Banks generally assume that·
they have the ability to counteract the
rising consumer prices via monetary
policy means.
Which one of the following is correct in
respect of two above statements?
(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II
are correct and Statement-II is the
correct explanation for Statement-I
(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II
are correct and Statement-II is
not the correct explanation for
Statement-I
(c) Statement-I is correct but
Statement-II is· incorrect
(d) Statement-I is incorrect but
Statement-II is correct

Answer :

The correct answer is (a). Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I.

Statement-I is correct because many central banks worldwide have indeed carried out interest rate hikes in the post-pandemic recent past. For example, the US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 75 basis points since March 2022. The Bank of England has raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points four times since December 2021. The European Central Bank has not yet raised interest rates, but it has signaled that it will do so in the near future.

Statement-II is correct because central banks generally assume that they have the ability to counteract rising consumer prices via monetary policy means. When interest rates are raised, it becomes more expensive for businesses to borrow money, which can lead to slower economic growth. This, in turn, can help to reduce inflation.

Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I because the interest rate hikes that have been carried out by central banks in the post-pandemic recent past are an attempt to counteract rising consumer prices.

Q23. Consider the following statements :
Statement-I :
Carbon markets are likdy to be one of
the most widespread tools in the fight
against climate change.
Statement-II :
Carbon markets transfer resources
from the private sector to the State.
Which one of the following is correct in
respect of the above statements?
(a) Both Statement-II and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I
(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II
are correct and Statement-II is
not the correct explanation for
Statement-I
(c) Statement-I is correct but
Statement-II is incorrect
(d) Statement-I is incorrect . but
Statement-II is correct

Answer :

The correct answer is (a). Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I.

**Statement-I:** Carbon markets are likely to be one of the most widespread tools in the fight against climate change.

Carbon markets are a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by creating a financial incentive for businesses and individuals to reduce their emissions. Businesses can buy carbon credits from other businesses or organizations that have reduced their emissions below a certain level. These credits can then be used to offset the emissions of the business that purchased them.

Carbon markets have the potential to be a very effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They can be used to reduce emissions from a wide range of sources, including power plants, factories, and transportation. They can also be used to encourage businesses to invest in new technologies that reduce emissions.

**Statement-II:** Carbon markets transfer resources from the private sector to the State.

When a business buys carbon credits from another business or organization, it is essentially paying that business to reduce its emissions. This money then goes to the State, which can use it to fund climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.

In this way, carbon markets can help to transfer resources from the private sector to the State. This can be a valuable way of raising money to address climate change, and it can also help to ensure that the costs of reducing emissions are shared fairly.

So, both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct. And Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I.

Q25. Consider the following markets :
1. Government Bond Market
2. Call Money Market
3. Treasury Bill Market
4. Stock Market
How many of the above are included
in capital markets?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

Answer :

The correct answer is (d). All four markets are included in capital markets.

* Government Bond Market: This market is where governments raise money by selling bonds. Bonds are a type of debt instrument that investors buy in exchange for a fixed interest payment and the repayment of the principal amount at maturity.
* Call Money Market: This market is where banks lend money to each other overnight. The term "call money" refers to the fact that the loans are callable, meaning that the borrower can repay them at any time.
* Treasury Bill Market: This market is where the U.S. government sells short-term debt securities called Treasury bills. Treasury bills are considered to be one of the safest investments available, and they are often used as a benchmark for other interest rates.
* Stock Market: This market is where shares of companies are bought and sold. Shares represent ownership in a company, and investors buy shares in the hope that the company will grow and that the value of their shares will increase.

All four of these markets are considered to be capital markets because they allow businesses and governments to raise long-term capital. Long-term capital is used to finance investments in things like new equipment, research and development, and expansion. Capital markets play an important role in the economy by providing businesses and governments with the resources they need to grow and create jobs.

Q26. Which one of the following best describes
the concept of 'Small Farmer Large
Field'?
(a) Resettlement of a large number
of people, uprooted from their
countries due to war, by giving
them a large cultivable land which
they cultivate collectively and share
the produce
(b) Many marginal farmers in an area
organize themselves into groups ·
and synchronize and harmonize
selected agricultural operations
(c) Many marginal farmers in an area
together . make a contract with
a corporate body and surrender
their land to· the corporate body
for a fixed term for which the
corporate body makes. a payment
of agreed amount to the farmers
(d) A company extends loans, technical
knowledge and material inputs to
a number of small farmers in
an area so that they produce the
agricultural commodity required
by the company for its
manufacturing process and
commercial production

Answer :

The correct answer is **(b)**. Small Farmer Large Field (SFLF) is a collective action model where many marginal farmers in an area organize themselves into groups and synchronize and harmonize selected agricultural operations. This can involve sharing equipment, sharing labor, collectively marketing their produce, and adopting modern farming techniques. By working together, small farmers can achieve economies of scale, improve efficiency, and enhance productivity. This can help them to increase their income and improve their livelihoods.

Option **(a)** is incorrect because it describes the concept of resettlement, not SFLF. Option **(c)** is incorrect because it describes the concept of contract farming, not SFLF. Option **(d)** is incorrect because it describes the concept of contract farming, not SFLF.

Q27. Consider the following statements :
1. The Government of India provides
Minimum Support Price for niger(Guizotia aoyssinica) seeds.
2. Niger is cultivated as a Kharifcrop.
3. Some tribal people in India use
niger seed oil for cooking. .
How many of the above statements are
correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

Answer :

The correct answer is (b). Only statements 1 and 3 are correct.

Statement 1 is correct because the Government of India provides Minimum Support Price for niger seeds. This means that the government guarantees to buy niger seeds from farmers at a minimum price, even if the market price is lower. This helps to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their crops.

Statement 2 is incorrect because niger is not a Kharif crop. Kharif crops are planted in the rainy season, while niger is planted in the winter.

Statement 3 is correct because some tribal people in India use niger seed oil for cooking. Niger seed oil is a good source of nutrients, and it has a nutty flavor that is popular in some cuisines.

Here is a table that summarizes the correctness of each statement:

Statement | Correct?
------- | --------
1. The Government of India provides Minimum Support Price for niger(Guizotia aoyssinica) seeds. | Yes
2. Niger is cultivated as a Kharifcrop. | No
3. Some tribal people in India use niger seed oil for cooking. | Yes

Q29. Consider the following :
1. Demographic performance
2. Fore~t and ecology
3. Governance reforms
4. Stable government
5. Tax and fiscal efforts
For the horizontal tax devolution, the
Fifteenth Finance Commission used
how many of the above as criteria
other than population area and income
distance?
(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five

Answer :

The answer is (b).

The Fifteenth Finance Commission used only three of the criteria listed above as criteria for horizontal tax devolution other than population, area, and income distance. These three criteria are:

* Demographic performance
* Forest and ecology
* Tax and fiscal efforts

The Commission did not use the criteria of governance reforms or stable government for horizontal tax devolution.

Q32. Consider the following statements :
Statement-I :
In India, prisons are managed by
State Govemments with their own
rules and regulations for the
day-to-day administration of prisons.
Statement-II :
In India, prisons are governed by the
Prisons Act, 1894 which expressly
kept the subject of prisons in the
control of Provincial Governments.
Which one of the following is correct in
respect of the above statements?
(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II
are correct and Statement-II is the
correct explanation for Statement-I
(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II
are correct and Statement-II is
not the correct explanation for
Statement-I
(c) Statement-I is correct but
Statement-II is incorrect
(d) Statement-I is incorrect but
Statement-II is correct

Answer :

The correct answer is (a). Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I.

Statement-I states that prisons in India are managed by State Governments with their own rules and regulations for the day-to-day administration of prisons. This is correct. The Constitution of India has placed prisons in the State List, which means that the management and administration of prisons is the responsibility of the State Governments. The Prisons Act, 1894 is the main law governing prisons in India. However, the Act gives the State Governments a lot of flexibility in how they manage their prisons. This is why each State Government has its own set of rules and regulations for the day-to-day administration of prisons.

Statement-II states that prisons in India are governed by the Prisons Act, 1894 which expressly kept the subject of prisons in the control of Provincial Governments. This is also correct. The Prisons Act, 1894 was enacted by the British colonial government. The Act was designed to give the colonial government control over prisons in India. The Act was not repealed after India gained independence in 1947. Instead, the Indian government adopted the Act as its own law. The Act has been amended several times since it was adopted, but it still gives the State Governments a lot of flexibility in how they manage their prisons.

Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I because it explains why the State Governments have the authority to manage their prisons with their own rules and regulations.

Q34. In India, which one of the following
Constitutional Amendments was widely
believed to be enacted to overcome
the judicial interpretations of the
Fundamental Rights?
(a) 1st Amendment
(b) 42nd Amendment
(c) 44th Amendment
(d) 86th Amendment

Answer :

The answer is (b).

The 42nd Amendment was enacted by the Indian government in 1976 during the Emergency. The amendment made a number of changes to the Constitution, including:

* Redefining the Preamble to include the words "socialist" and "secular"
* Giving the government more power to control the media and other forms of communication
* Reducing the power of the judiciary to review laws passed by Parliament

The amendment was widely seen as an attempt by the government to curb dissent and consolidate its power. It was repealed in 1977 after the Emergency ended.

The other amendments listed are not as significant as the 42nd Amendment. The 1st Amendment was enacted to protect the freedom of speech and religion. The 44th Amendment was enacted to make India a more secular state. The 86th Amendment was enacted to make education a fundamental right.

Q35. Consider the following organizations/
bodies in India :
1. The National Commission for
Backward Classes
2. The National Human Rights
Commission
3. The National Law Commission
4. The National Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission
How many of the above are
constitutional bodies?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

Answer :

The answer is (a) Only one.

The National Commission for Backward Classes is the only constitutional body among the four given options. The other three bodies are statutory bodies, which means they were created by an Act of Parliament. A constitutional body is a body or institute established by the Constitution of India. They can only be created or changed by passing a constitutional amendment bill, rather than an Act of Parliament.

The National Commission for Backward Classes was established by the Constitution (Eighty-Ninth Amendment) Act, 2000. It is a statutory body, but it has been given constitutional status by the 93rd Amendment. The National Human Rights Commission, the National Law Commission, and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission are all statutory bodies.

Q49. Who among the following rulers of
medieval Gujarat surrendered Diu to
Portuguese?
(a) Ahmad Shah
(b) Mahmud Begarha
(c) Bahadur Shah
(d) Muhammad Shah

Answer :

The correct answer is (c). Bahadur Shah, the Sultan of Gujarat from 1526 to 1537, surrendered Diu to the Portuguese in 1534. He did this in exchange for Portuguese assistance against the Mughals, who were threatening his kingdom.

Ahmad Shah (reigned 1411-1442) and Mahmud Begada (reigned 1451-1511) were both powerful sultans of Gujarat who expanded the kingdom's territory and made it a major economic and cultural center. However, neither of them surrendered Diu to the Portuguese.

Muhammad Shah (reigned 1537-1543) was the son of Bahadur Shah and succeeded him to the throne after his death. He tried to regain control of Diu from the Portuguese, but was unsuccessful.

The Portuguese were able to take control of Diu because they had a strong navy and were able to blockade the port. They also had the support of some local Gujarati merchants who were eager to trade with them. The loss of Diu was a major blow to the Gujarat Sultanate and contributed to its decline in the 16th century.

hemoglobinopathies and fluorosis.
How many of the statements given
above are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

Answer :

The correct answer is (d). All four statements are correct.

1. Anaemia Mukt Bharat Strategy does not provide prophylactic calcium supplementation. It provides prophylactic iron and folic acid supplementation.
2. Anaemia Mukt Bharat Strategy does run a campaign for delayed cord clamping at the time of childbirth.
3. Anaemia Mukt Bharat Strategy does provide for periodic deworming to children and adolescents.
4. Anaemia Mukt Bharat Strategy does address non-nutritional causes of anaemia in endemic pockets with special focus on malaria, haemoglobinopathies and fluorosis.

Here are some additional details about each of the interventions:

* Prophylactic iron and folic acid supplementation: This is a key intervention in the Anaemia Mukt Bharat Strategy. It is given to pregnant women, adolescent girls, and children under the age of 5. Iron is essential for the production of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood. Folic acid is important for the development of the fetus and the prevention of neural tube defects.
* Delayed cord clamping: This is another key intervention in the Anaemia Mukt Bharat Strategy. It involves leaving the umbilical cord attached to the baby for at least 3 minutes after birth. This allows for the transfer of more blood from the placenta to the baby, which can help to prevent anemia.
* Periodic deworming: This is an important intervention for preventing anemia caused by parasitic worms. Deworming tablets are given to children and adolescents at least twice a year.
* Addressing non-nutritional causes of anemia: This is an important part of the Anaemia Mukt Bharat Strategy. It includes measures to prevent and treat malaria, hemoglobinopathies, and fluorosis, which are all non-nutritional causes of anemia.

The Anaemia Mukt Bharat Strategy is a comprehensive and ambitious program that aims to reduce anemia in India. The four interventions discussed above are all important components of this strategy.

In how many of the above actions is the
function of accelerometer required?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

Answer :

The answer is (c). All three of the actions listed require the function of an accelerometer.

In the first action, the accelerometer detects the sudden acceleration of the car during a crash. This triggers the deployment of the airbags, which helps to protect the occupants of the car from injury.

In the second action, the accelerometer detects the sudden acceleration of the laptop as it falls. This triggers the immediate turning off of the hard drive, which helps to prevent data loss.

In the third action, the accelerometer detects the tilt of the smartphone. This triggers the rotation of the display between portrait and landscape mode, which makes it easier for the user to view the screen in different orientations.

Accelerometers are used in a wide variety of devices, including cars, laptops, smartphones, and other electronic devices. They are used to measure acceleration, which can be used for a variety of purposes, such as detecting collisions, preventing data loss, and rotating displays.

Q55. With reference to the role of biofilters
in Recirculating Aquaculture System,
consider the following statements :
1. Biofilters provide waste treatment
by removing uneaten fish feed.
2. Biofilters convert ammonia present
in fish waste to nitrate.
3 . Biofilters increase phosphorus as
nutrient for fish in water.
How many of the statements given
above are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None.

Answer :

The answer is (b). Only statements 1 and 2 are correct.

* Statement 1 is correct because biofilters provide waste treatment by removing uneaten fish feed, fish feces, and other organic matter from the water. This helps to improve water quality and reduce the risk of disease.
* Statement 2 is correct because biofilters contain bacteria that convert ammonia, a toxic waste product of fish metabolism, into nitrate, a less toxic form of nitrogen. Nitrate is then removed from the water by plants or other organisms.
* Statement 3 is incorrect because biofilters do not increase phosphorus levels in the water. Phosphorus is another important nutrient for fish, but it is not removed from the water by biofilters. Instead, phosphorus is typically added to the water in the form of fish food or fertilizer.

Here are some additional details about the role of biofilters in recirculating aquaculture systems:

* Biofilters are an essential part of any recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). They help to remove harmful waste products from the water, such as ammonia, nitrite, and phosphorus. This helps to improve water quality and reduce the risk of disease.
* There are many different types of biofilters that can be used in RAS. The type of biofilter that is best for a particular system will depend on the size of the system, the type of fish being raised, and the desired water quality standards.
* Biofilters require regular maintenance to ensure that they are functioning properly. This includes monitoring the water quality, cleaning the biofilter media, and adding new bacteria as needed.

By using biofilters, RAS operators can produce high-quality fish in a sustainable manner.

of mercury pollution in the world.
2. Coal-based thermal power plants
cause mercury pollution.
3. There is no known ·safe level of
exposure to mercury.
How many of the above statements are
correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

Answer :

The correct answer is (c). All three statements are correct.

* Gold mining activity is a major source of mercury pollution in the world. Mercury is used in the extraction of gold, and it can be released into the environment during mining and processing activities.
* Coal-based thermal power plants are also a major source of mercury pollution. Mercury is released into the atmosphere when coal is burned, and it can then be deposited in water and soil.
* There is no known safe level of exposure to mercury. Even low levels of exposure can have negative health effects, including neurological damage, developmental delays, and birth defects.

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has estimated that global mercury emissions are about 2,200 metric tons per year. Of this, about 1,300 metric tons are emitted from human activities, with the majority coming from coal-fired power plants and gold mining.

Mercury pollution is a global problem that has serious health and environmental consequences. It is important to reduce mercury emissions from all sources, and to protect people from exposure to mercury.

Q63. Consider the following statements
Statement-I :
The soil in tropical
al rain forests is rich
in nutrients.
Statement-II :
The high temperature and moisture
of tropical rain forests cause
dead organic matter in the soil to
decompose quickly.
Which one of the following is correct in
respect of the above statements?
(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II
are correct and Statement-II is the
correct explanation for Statement-I
(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II
are correct and Statement-II is
not the correct explanation for
Statement-II
(c) Statement-II is correct but
Statement-II is incorrect
(d) Statement-I is incorrect but
Statement-II is correct

Answer :

The answer is (d).

Statement I is incorrect. The soil in tropical rainforests is actually quite poor in nutrients. This is because the high temperature and moisture of tropical rainforests cause dead organic matter in the soil to decompose quickly. When organic matter decomposes, it releases nutrients into the soil. However, in tropical rainforests, the nutrients are quickly washed away by the heavy rains. As a result, the soil in tropical rainforests is often very nutrient-poor.

Statement II is correct. The high temperature and moisture of tropical rainforests do cause dead organic matter in the soil to decompose quickly. However, this does not mean that the soil is rich in nutrients. In fact, the opposite is true. The rapid decomposition of organic matter in tropical rainforests actually contributes to the nutrient-poor nature of the soil.

Therefore, both statements are correct, but statement II is not the correct explanation for statement I.

(c) Using air-borne devices to collect blood samples from moving
animals
(d) Sending drones to inaccessible
areas to col.lect plant and animal
samples from land surfaces and
water bodies

Answer :

The answer is (a). Aerial metagenomics is the process of collecting DNA samples from the air in a habitat at one go. This is done by using air-borne devices, such as drones, to collect air samples. The DNA samples are then analyzed to identify the different types of microorganisms that are present in the air.

Option (b) is incorrect because it refers to understanding the genetic makeup of avian species of a habitat. This is not specifically related to aerial metagenomics.

Option (c) is incorrect because it refers to using air-borne devices to collect blood samples from moving animals. This is not specifically related to aerial metagenomics.

Option (d) is incorrect because it refers to sending drones to inaccessible areas to collect plant and animal samples from land surfaces and water bodies. This is not specifically related to aerial metagenomics.

(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II·
are correct and Statement-II is the
correct explanation for Statement-I
(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II
are correct and Statement-II is
not the correct explanation for
Statement-I
(c) Statement-I is correct but
Statement-II is incorrect
(d) Statement-I is incorrect but
Statement-If is correct

Answer :

The answer is (a).

Statement-I is correct. India's public sector health care system largely focuses on curative care with limited preventive, promotive and rehabilitative care. This is due to a number of factors, including:

* Underfunding of the public health system
* Lack of trained health workers
* Poor infrastructure
* Inadequate access to medicines and other essential medical supplies

Statement-II is also correct. Under India's decentralized approach to health care delivery, the States are primarily responsible for organizing health services. This means that the quality and availability of health care services can vary significantly from state to state.

Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I. The lack of investment in preventive, promotive and rehabilitative care by the states is one of the main reasons why India's public sector health care system largely focuses on curative care.

Here are some additional details about the two statements:

* Statement-I: India's public sector health care system largely focuses on curative care with limited preventive, promotive and rehabilitative care.
    * Curative care is the treatment of diseases or injuries after they have occurred.
    * Preventive care is the prevention of diseases or injuries from occurring in the first place.
    * Promotive care is the promotion of good health and well-being.
    * Rehabilitative care is the restoration of function and independence to people who have been injured or disabled.
* Statement-II: Under India's decentralized approach to health care delivery, the States are primarily responsible for organizing health services.
    * Decentralization is the transfer of power and decision-making from a central authority to local authorities.
    * In India, the states are responsible for planning, financing, and delivering health care services to their citizens.
